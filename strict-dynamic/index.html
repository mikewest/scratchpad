    <h1><code>strict-dynamic</code> at work:</h1>
    <p>
      This page has a CSP of <code>script-src 'nonce-abcdefg' 'strict-dynamic'</code>.
      <code>&lt;script src="./script.js" nonce="abcdefg">&lt;/script></code> will load,
      and that it will be able to load additional scripts (which, in turn, can load
      additional scripts) so long as those scripts are loaded via
      non-<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#parser-inserted">"parser-inserted"</a>
      <code>&lt;script></code> elements.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Note that this mechanism requires the use of either nonces or hashes to restrict
      the initial scripts that are directly loaded. If you need to constrain the sources
      from which scripts are loaded as well, you can do so via an additional policy which
      has an allowlist of hosts (e.g. <code>Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-abcdefg' 'strict-dynamic', script-src https://my.amazing.cdn</code>).
